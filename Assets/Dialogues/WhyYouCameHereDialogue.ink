Voice: Hey, don't you wonder what's inside of these memories you've lost.
Player: Not really, I just need to keep climbing, and everything will be fine. I think.
Voice: See, you don't even know why you're doing this.
Player: I don't need to know.
Voice: You're just running from the past, it's not that you don't need is that you don't want to.
Player: Shut up! I don't need your vain concern..
Voice: That way of thinking will only end in tragedy. It sure is a calming notion, but is a lie.
