It's not quite what I expected. #Player
This is what you wanted. #Voice
Im not going to complain. I can already feel my body failing me. #Player
I told you what was going to happen, but you refused to heed my words. #Voice
I don't regret it, I think this is quite a good ending for me. All stories are bound to end someday, and it so happens to be mine today. #Player
If you say so, see you on the other side. #Voice
This is goodbye I guess. #End
